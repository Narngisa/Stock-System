# Stock System Dessert 🍰

This is a Python project I developed while playing D&D. It’s not a random roll system or anything related to game mechanics, 
but rather a stock management system for managing various items, including a fridge to store desserts. 
Since I wanted to play as a dessert shop owner in a town rather than an adventurer, the DM gave me a choice between ordering desserts or making them myself. 
I chose to make them, only to find out later that it wasn’t as relaxing as I thought, because the DM required me to do all the calculations myself. 
On the first day, I tried tracking the desserts in Notepad, but it was too time-consuming, so I spent 10 hours developing a stock management program. 
I plan to keep improving it until I feel comfortable managing my dessert shop in D&D.
